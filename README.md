# Data Quality Score (DQS)

## Introduction
Assignment: Data Quality Score
Within Studyportals we have a Study object. This study object has some properties that are very important for students to decide which study they want to start. Besides that, there are values we need internally to help our students, and clients, in the best way possible
To be able to see which study objects are complete or not, we want a Data Quality Score application so we can see which studies need work to give the most up-to-date and accurate data. With this system you will be able to give each study a score. This score is built out of the scores each property provides.
